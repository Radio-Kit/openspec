## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Differentiated BLE Transmission Pacing
The `RadioKitBLE::sendPacket` method SHALL classify outgoing packets by protocol start byte and apply low-latency transmission pacing. Real-time packets (`0x55` widget/var updates and `0xDD` print stream) SHALL NOT execute long blocking delays when GATT notification fails due to stack congestion.

#### Scenario: Real-time packet under stack congestion
- **WHEN** a real-time widget packet (`0x55`) or print stream packet (`0xDD`) is sent and `NimBLECharacteristic::notify` returns false
- **THEN** the BLE transport yields execution without entering exponential multi-millisecond backoff delays and drops or defers the packet quickly (<1ms)

#### Scenario: Bulk or critical packet transmission
- **WHEN** a critical frame (`0xAA` FS, `0xBB` OTA, `0xCC` Settings) is sent and `NimBLECharacteristic::notify` returns false
- **THEN** the BLE transport retries with minimal bounded pacing (at most 1ms per retry, capped at 5 retries) without causing unbounded main loop stalls

### Requirement: Low Core Debug Logging Overhead
Platform configuration builds SHALL default `CORE_DEBUG_LEVEL` to <= 2 (Error or Warning) to prevent NimBLE debug chatter from saturating the serial bus during high-frequency GATT transactions.

#### Scenario: Continuous control input handling
- **WHEN** high-frequency control packets are received by the BLE GATT server
- **THEN** no verbose GATT write debug logs are emitted to the serial CDC stream, allowing structured application logs to remain clear
